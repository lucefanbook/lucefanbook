# Chaplet of Fatima

## Introduction

The Chaplet of Fatima is a devotional prayer inspired by the apparitions of Our Lady to three shepherd children in Fatima, Portugal, in 1917. It incorporates prayers that were directly taught by an angel and by the Virgin Mary during these apparitions, focusing on themes of reparation, adoration, and conversion.
