# Chaplet of the Ten Virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary

## Introduction

The Chaplet of the Ten Virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary is a devotion inspired by the Marian virtues identified by St. Louis de Montfort. It focuses on meditating on Mary’s exemplary virtues and seeking to emulate her as a model of holiness. This chaplet is a beautiful way to grow in humility, purity, and other virtues while deepening one’s relationship with the Blessed Virgin and her Son, Jesus Christ.

This chaplet is traditionally prayed using a string of beads specifically designed for it, but it can also be adapted to a standard Marian Rosary.

## How to Pray This Chaplet

### Original Structure

The chaplet consists of a medal of the Blessed Virgin Mary, followed by ten groups of a single bead. Each bead represents one of Mary’s ten virtues:

 * Profound Humility
 * Lively Faith
 * Blind Obedience
 * Unceasing Prayer
 * Constant Self-Denial
 * Surpassing Purity
 * Ardent Love
 * Heroic Patience
 * Angelic Kindness
 * Heavenly Wisdom

On each bead, the corresponding virtue is meditated upon with specific prayers.

### Adaptation for Marian Rosary

 * Use one decade for each virtue, with a meditation on the virtue during the decade.
 * Recite the Our Father on the large bead, and a prayer invoking the virtue on each small bead.
 * Include a closing consecration prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary.

## Sign of the Cross

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

## Opening Prayers

### On the Crucifix:

Pray the Apostles’ Creed to affirm your faith.

### On the First Large Bead:

Recite the Our Father, asking for God’s guidance as you meditate on Mary’s virtues.

### On the Next Three Small Beads:

Pray three Hail Marys, reflecting on Mary as the model of virtue.

## Structure of the Chaplet

### Beginning of Each Decade

On the large bead, announce the virtue to be meditated on for that decade and pray the Our Father.
For example:

 * 1st Decade: "Profound Humility: O Mary, help me to grow in humility as you did."
 * 2nd Decade: "Lively Faith: O Mary, inspire in me a faith that is alive and unwavering."
 * (Continue similarly for the other virtues.)

### Decade Prayer

On each of the ten small beads, pray:

Blessed Mother, full of grace, grant me the grace to imitate your virtue of [Virtue Name].

Reflect deeply on the virtue during the prayers.

### End of Each Decade

Conclude each decade with the Glory Be.

#### Add an invocation:

O Mary, Mother of Virtues, pray for us.

### Closing Prayer

After completing the ten virtues, recite this prayer:

O Blessed Virgin Mary, Mother of God and my Mother, I consecrate myself to your Immaculate Heart. Help me to imitate your virtues and grow in holiness. Lead me closer to your Son, Jesus Christ. Amen.

### Final Sign of the Cross

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.
