Hereâ€™s how to pray the Chaplet of St. Michael using a standard 5-decade rosary, with adaptations to account for the differences in bead structure:
1. Begin with the Sign of the Cross

    In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

2. Opening Prayers

Pray the following to start:

    "O God, come to my assistance. O Lord, make haste to help me. Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen."

3. Honor the Nine Choirs of Angels

For each choir of angels, follow these steps:
Step 1: Announce the Choir

Announce the choir you are honoring, starting with the Seraphim:

    Seraphim
    Cherubim
    Thrones
    Dominions
    Virtues
    Powers
    Principalities
    Archangels
    Angels

For example:

    "By the intercession of St. Michael and the celestial Choir of Seraphim, may the Lord make us worthy to burn with the fire of perfect charity."

Step 2: Pray an Our Father

On the large bead (Our Father bead of the decade), pray:

    "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen."

Step 3: Pray Three Hail Marys

On the first three small beads, pray:

    "Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. Amen."

4. Continue for All Nine Choirs

Repeat Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3 for each of the nine choirs of angels, moving from one decade to the next.
5. Concluding Prayers

After completing all nine choirs, pray the following:
Prayer to St. Michael

    "O glorious prince St. Michael, chief and commander of the heavenly hosts, guardian of souls, vanquisher of rebel spirits, servant in the house of the Divine King and our admirable conductor, you who shine with excellence and superhuman virtue, deliver us from all evil, who turn to you with confidence, and enable us by your gracious protection to serve God more and more faithfully every day. Amen."

Four Our Fathers

Pray one Our Father each in honor of:

    St. Michael,
    St. Gabriel,
    St. Raphael,
    Your Guardian Angel.

6. Final Sign of the Cross

    In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

Notes on Using a 5-Decade Rosary:

    Use the large beads for the Our Father of each choir.
    Use the first three small beads of each decade for the Three Hail Marys of each choir.
    Continue through all five decades and cycle back as needed to cover all nine choirs.

This adaptation makes the Chaplet of St. Michael fully compatible with a traditional 5-decade rosary.
