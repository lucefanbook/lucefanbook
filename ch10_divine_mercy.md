## Introduction

The Divine Mercy Chaplet is traditionally prayed at 3:00 PM, the hour of mercy, commemorating the time of Jesus’ death on the Cross. However, it can be prayed at any time.  

Divine Mercy Novena: You can incorporate the chaplet into the nine-day Divine Mercy Novena, which begins on Good Friday and ends on Divine Mercy Sunday (the Sunday after Easter).  

Meditation on Mercy: While praying, meditate on God's mercy and the Passion of Jesus, offering each prayer for the forgiveness of sins and the needs of the world.

### Opening Prayers

#### Optional Prayer (St. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners)

O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners.  
O sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor sinners.  
O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy from which gush forth rays of inconceivable graces upon the entire human race, I beg of You light for poor sinners.  
O Jesus, be mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear a price of Your most precious Blood.  
O Jesus, when I consider the great price of Your Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one drop alone would have been enough for the salvation of all sinners.  
Although sin is an abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the price paid for us can never be equalled.  
Therefore, let every soul trust in the Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in His mercy.  
God will not deny His mercy to anyone.  
Heaven and earth may change, but God's mercy will never be exhausted.  
Oh, what immense joy burns in my heart when I contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O Jesus!  
I desire to bring all sinners to Your feet that they may glorify Your mercy throughout endless ages.

#### On the crucifix (From the Diary of St. Faustina, 1319)
