## Introduction

The Divine Mercy Chaplet is traditionally prayed at 3:00 PM, the hour of mercy, commemorating the time of Jesusâ€™ death on the Cross. However, it can be prayed at any time.  

Divine Mercy Novena: You can incorporate the chaplet into the nine-day Divine Mercy Novena, which begins on Good Friday and ends on Divine Mercy Sunday (the Sunday after Easter).  

Meditation on Mercy: While praying, meditate on God's mercy and the Passion of Jesus, offering each prayer for the forgiveness of sins and the needs of the world.
