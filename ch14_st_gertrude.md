# Chaplet of St. Gertrude

## Introduction

The Chaplet of St. Gertrude is a Catholic devotional prayer dedicated to offering prayers for the souls in Purgatory, based on the revelations and devotions of St. Gertrude the Great, a 13th-century Benedictine nun. Jesus reportedly revealed to her that each time this prayer is said, a thousand souls would be released from Purgatory.
