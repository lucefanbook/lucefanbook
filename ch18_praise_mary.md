### Opening Prayer (Act of Reparation to Mary)

Mary, my Immaculate Mother,  
I desire to offer thee reparation for the offenses  
which thy Immaculate Heart  
receives from the horrible blasphemies  
which are uttered against thee.  
I offer thee these praises  
to console thee for so many ungrateful children  
who do not love thee,  
and to console the Heart of thy Divine Son  
Who is so deeply offended by the insults offered to thee.  
Receive, my Purest Mother,  
this little act of homage.  
Make me love thee more each day  
and look with pity on those blasphemers  
that they may not delay to cast themselves  
into thy maternal arms.

Amen.

### On each decade

#### On the large bead (Crown of Excellence)

Grant that I may praise thee, O Holy Virgin! Give me strength against thy enemies!

#### On each small beads (Divine Praises to Mary - one line per bead)

Blessed be the Great Mother of God, Mary Most Holy!  
Blessed be her Holy and Immaculate Conception!  
Blessed be her Glorious Assumption!  
Blessed be the Name of Mary, Virgin and Mother!  
Blessed be her Immaculate Heart!  
Blessed be her Virginal Purity!  
Blessed be her Divine Maternity!  
Blessed be her Universal Mediation!  
Blessed be her Sorrows and her Tears!  
Blessed be the graces with which the Lord crowned her Queen of Heaven and Earth!

#### End of the decade (Glory to Mary)

Glory be to Mary, Daughter of the Father!  
Glory be to Mary, Mother of the Son!  
Glory be to Mary, Spouse of the Holy Spirit!

### Closing Prayer (repeat five times)

My Mother,  
I love thee for those who do not love thee;  
I praise thee for those who blaspheme thee;  
I surrender myself to thee  
for those who will not recognize thee as their Mother.
