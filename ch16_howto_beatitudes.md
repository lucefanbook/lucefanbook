# Chaplet of the Beatitudes

## Introduction

The Chaplet of the Beatitudes is a devotional prayer reflecting on the teachings of Jesus in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5:1–12). It helps deepen our understanding and commitment to living out the Beatitudes, which are a blueprint for Christian holiness and the path to true happiness. This chaplet draws the faithful closer to God by meditating on each Beatitude and asking for the grace to embody its virtues.

While traditionally prayed with a specific chaplet design, this version has been adapted for use with a Marian rosary. The adaptation allows the faithful to reflect on all ten Beatitudes by praying the rosary twice, with one Beatitude as the focus for each decade.

## How to Pray This Chaplet

### Original Structure

Traditionally, the Chaplet of the Beatitudes consists of nine groups of beads (one for each Beatitude) and introductory/closing prayers. Each group of beads involves meditating on one Beatitude while praying for the grace to live according to its teaching.

## Adaptation for Marian Rosary

This chaplet is adapted to the five-decade structure of the Marian rosary. Each decade focuses on one Beatitude, and since there are ten Beatitudes, the chaplet is prayed twice to reflect on all of them. The large bead introduces the Beatitude, and the small beads are used for reflective prayers.

Key adaptations:

 * One Beatitude per decade: The ten Beatitudes are spread across two recitations of the rosary.
 * Reflective prayers: Instead of Hail Marys, the small beads focus on invocations related to the Beatitude.

## Sign of the Cross

"In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."

## Opening Prayers

### On the Crucifix, pray: 

Recite the Apostles’ Creed or an opening prayer, such as:

"Heavenly Father, I come before you with a humble heart, seeking to live according to the teachings of your Son, Jesus Christ. Through this chaplet, may I grow in virtue and holiness. Amen."

### On the First Large Bead: Pray the Our Father.

### On the Next Three Small Beads: Pray for the virtues of faith, hope, and charity, saying:

 * "Holy Spirit, grant me faith."
 * "Holy Spirit, grant me hope."
 * "Holy Spirit, grant me charity."

### On the Next Large Bead: Pray the Glory Be.
