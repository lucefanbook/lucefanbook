# The rosary

The Rosary is a structured prayer tool in the Catholic tradition, consisting of beads arranged in a specific pattern. Each component of the Rosary serves a particular purpose in guiding the prayers.

## Structure of the Rosary

### 1. The Crucifix

Located at the end of the Rosary.

Used to begin the Rosary with the Sign of the Cross and the Apostles' Creed, which professes the core beliefs of the Catholic faith.

### 2. The Opening Beads

#### One Large Bead:

After the crucifix, this bead is for praying the Our Father (also known as the Lord's Prayer).

#### Three Small Beads:

Following the first large bead, these are for praying three Hail Marys, traditionally offered for an increase in the theological virtues of faith, hope, and charity.

#### The Space between the Small and Large Bead:

Concluding the opening prayers, this space or chain link is for praying the Glory Be (also called the Doxology), praising the Holy Trinity.

#### Another Large Bead:

This bead serve as the large bead of the first decade.

### 3. The Decades

The main body of the Rosary consists of five decades, each focusing on a specific mystery related to the life of Jesus Christ and the Virgin Mary.

Each decade is composed of:

#### One Large Bead:

Before starting each decade, this bead is for the Our Father.

#### Ten Small Beads:

These beads are for the Hail Mary, recited ten times as a form of meditation on the mystery.

#### The Space Between Decades:

After the ten Hail Marys, a Glory Be is recited on this space or chain link, often followed by the optional Fatima Prayer.

### 4. The Centerpiece (or Medal)

Located between the introductory prayers and the decades, this is typically a medal or connecting piece.

It often depicts an image of Mary, Jesus, or a particular Marian devotion.

Marks the transition between the opening prayers and the first decade.

# The rosary around Luce's neck

The rosary that Luce is wearing is the Mission Rosary, also known as the World Mission Rosary. It is a special devotion created in 1951 by Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen. Its purpose is to encourage Catholics to pray for the missions of the Church worldwide and to remind them of their spiritual connection to all people. The Mission Rosary assigns each decade a specific intention for a region of the world, symbolizing the universality of the Church and the missionary work carried out globally.

## Structure and Purpose

The Mission Rosary follows the traditional structure of the Rosary but adds a unique layer of meaning by associating each decade with a particular geographical area. The beads for each decade are often colored differently to represent these regions and their corresponding prayer intentions:

Prayer Intention: For the people and missions of the Americas, especially indigenous populations and those who serve them.

### 3. Third Decade: White (Europe)
