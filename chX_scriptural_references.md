## The Joyful Mysteries

### The Annunciation:

#### Luke 1:26-38 – Gabriel announces to Mary that she will conceive Jesus.

26 In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth,  
27 to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name was Mary.  
28 And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”  
29 But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be.  
30 The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.  
31 And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus.  
32 He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David.  
33 He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”  
34 Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?”  
35 The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be holy; he will be called Son of God.  
36 And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren.  
37 For nothing will be impossible with God.”  
38 Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.


### The Visitation:

#### Luke 1:39-56 – Mary visits Elizabeth, who proclaims, "Blessed are you among women."

Mary Visits Elizabeth

39 In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country,  
40 where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth.  
41 When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit  
42 and exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.  
43 And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me?  
44 For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy.  
45 And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.”

Mary’s Song of Praise (The Magnificat)

46 And Mary said, “My soul magnifies the Lord,  
47 and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,  
48 for he has looked with favor on the lowliness of his servant. Surely, from now on all generations will call me blessed;  
49 for the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name.  
50 His mercy is for those who fear him from generation to generation.  
51 He has shown strength with his arm; he has scattered the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.  
52 He has brought down the powerful from their thrones, and lifted up the lowly;  
53 he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the rich away empty.  
54 He has helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy,  
55 according to the promise he made to our ancestors, to Abraham and to his descendants forever.”  
56 And Mary remained with her about three months and then returned to her home.

### The Nativity:

#### Luke 2:1-20 – Jesus is born in Bethlehem and laid in a manger.

The Birth of Jesus

1 In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered.  
2 This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.  
3 All went to their own towns to be registered.  
4 Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David.  
5 He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child.  
6 While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child.  
7 And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

The Shepherds and the Angels

8 In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night.  
9 Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.  
10 But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid; for see—I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people:  
11 to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord.  
12 This will be a sign for you: you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.”  
13 And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,  
14 “Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”

The Shepherds Visit the Manger

15 When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.”  
16 So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger.  
17 When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child;  
18 and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.  
19 But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart.  
20 The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

### The Presentation in the Temple:

#### Luke 2:22-38 – Mary and Joseph present Jesus in the Temple; Simeon and Anna recognize Him as the Messiah.

Jesus Is Presented in the Temple

22 When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord  
23 (as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every firstborn male shall be designated as holy to the Lord”),  
24 and they offered a sacrifice according to what is stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”

The Prophecy of Simeon

25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.  
26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.  
27 Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,  
28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,  
29 “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
according to your word;  
30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,  
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,  
32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel.”  
33 And the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.  
34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed  
35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your own soul too.”

The Prophecy of Anna

36 There was also a prophet, Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, having lived with her husband seven years after her marriage,  
37 then as a widow to the age of eighty-four. She never left the temple but worshiped there with fasting and prayer night and day.  
38 At that moment she came, and began to praise God and to speak about the child to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.

### The Finding of Jesus in the Temple:

#### Luke 2:41-50 – At age twelve, Jesus is found teaching in the Temple.

The Boy Jesus in the Temple

41 Now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover.  
42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival.  
43 When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.  
44 Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends.  
45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.  
46 After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.  
47 And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.  
48 When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.”  
49 He said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”  
50 But they did not understand what he said to them.

## The Luminous Mysteries

### The Baptism of Jesus in the Jordan:

#### Matthew 3:13-17 – The Holy Spirit descends upon Jesus as He is baptized.

The Baptism of Jesus

13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.  
14 John would have prevented him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”  
15 But Jesus answered him, “Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he consented.  
16 And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him.  
17 And a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased.”

#### Mark 1:9-11

The Baptism of Jesus

9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.  
10 And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.  
11 And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”

#### Luke 3:21-22

The Baptism of Jesus

21 Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened,  
22 and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, “You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased.”

#### John 1:29-34

The Lamb of God

29 The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him and declared, “Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!  
30 This is he of whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.’  
31 I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.”  
32 And John testified, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.  
33 I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, ‘He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’  
34 And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”

### The Wedding Feast at Cana:

#### John 2:1-12 – Jesus performs His first miracle, turning water into wine.

The Wedding at Cana

1 On the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.  
2 Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.  
3 When the wine gave out, the mother of Jesus said to him, “They have no wine.”
4 And Jesus said to her, “Woman, what concern is that to you and to me? My hour has not yet come.”  
5 His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”  
6 Now standing there were six stone water jars for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.  
7 Jesus said to them, “Fill the jars with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.  
8 He said to them, “Now draw some out, and take it to the chief steward.” So they took it.  
9 When the steward tasted the water that had become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward called the bridegroom  
10 and said to him, “Everyone serves the good wine first, and then the inferior wine after the guests have become drunk. But you have kept the good wine until now.”  
11 Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee, and revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.  
12 After this he went down to Capernaum with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples; and they remained there a few days.

### The Proclamation of the Kingdom of God:

#### Mark 1:14-15 – Jesus proclaims, "The kingdom of God is at hand."

The Beginning of the Galilean Ministry

14 Now after John was arrested, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God,  
15 and saying, “The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has come near; repent, and believe in the good news.”

#### Matthew 4:23 – Jesus preaches the Gospel and heals the sick.

Jesus Ministers to Crowds of People

23 Jesus went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and curing every disease and every sickness among the people.

#### Luke 4:16-21 – Jesus reads from Isaiah in the synagogue.

The Rejection of Jesus at Nazareth

16 When he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he went to the synagogue on the sabbath day, as was his custom. He stood up to read,  
17 and the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where it was written:  
18 “The Spirit of the Lord is upon me,
because he has anointed me
to bring good news to the poor.
He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives
and recovery of sight to the blind,
to let the oppressed go free,  
19 to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.”  
20 And he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. The eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed on him.  
21 Then he began to say to them, “Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”

#### John 8:12 – Jesus declares, "I am the light of the world."

Jesus the Light of the World

12 Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness but will have the light of life.”

### The Transfiguration:

#### Matthew 17:1-8 – Jesus is transfigured before Peter, James, and John.

1 Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.  
2 And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became dazzling white.  
3 Suddenly there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him.  
4 Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here; if you wish, I will make three dwellings here, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  
5 While he was still speaking, suddenly a bright cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud a voice said, “This is my Son, the Beloved; with him I am well pleased; listen to him!”  
6 When the disciples heard this, they fell to the ground and were overcome by fear.  
7 But Jesus came and touched them, saying, “Get up and do not be afraid.”  
8 And when they looked up, they saw no one except Jesus himself alone.

#### Mark 9:2-8

The Transfiguration

2 Six days later, Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain apart, by themselves. And he was transfigured before them,  
3 and his clothes became dazzling white, such as no one on earth could bleach them.  
4 And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, who were talking with Jesus.  
5 Then Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”  
6 He did not know what to say, for they were terrified.  
7 Then a cloud overshadowed them, and from the cloud there came a voice, “This is my Son, the Beloved; listen to him!”  
8 Suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them anymore, but only Jesus.

#### Luke 9:28-36

The Transfiguration

28 Now about eight days after these sayings, Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.  
29 And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white.  
30 Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him.  
31 They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.  
32 Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.  
33 Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said.  
34 While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud.  
35 Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!”  
36 When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.

### The Institution of the Eucharist:

#### Matthew 26:26-30 – Jesus gives His Body and Blood at the Last Supper.

The Institution of the Lord’s Supper

26 While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to the disciples, and said, “Take, eat; this is my body.”  
27 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you;  
28 for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.  
29 I tell you, I will never again drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.”  
30 When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

#### Mark 14:22-26

The Institution of the Lord’s Supper

22 While they were eating, he took a loaf of bread, and after blessing it he broke it, gave it to them, and said, “Take; this is my body.”  
23 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he gave it to them, and all of them drank from it.  
24 He said to them, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many.  
25 Truly I tell you, I will never again drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.”  
26 When they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

#### Luke 22:14-20

The Institution of the Lord’s Supper

14 When the hour came, he took his place at the table, and the apostles with him.  
15 He said to them, “I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;  
16 for I tell you, I will not eat it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.”  
17 Then he took a cup, and after giving thanks he said, “Take this and divide it among yourselves;  
18 for I tell you that from now on I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God comes.”  
19 Then he took a loaf of bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to them, saying, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”  
20 And he did the same with the cup after supper, saying, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood.

#### John 6:35-59 – Jesus declares Himself the Bread of Life.

The Bread of Life

35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry, and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.  
36 But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.  
37 Everything that the Father gives me will come to me, and anyone who comes to me I will never drive away;  
38 for I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.  
39 And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up on the last day.  
40 This is indeed the will of my Father, that all who see the Son and believe in him may have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day.”  
41 Then the Jews began to complain about him because he said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.”  
42 They were saying, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How can he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”  
43 Jesus answered them, “Do not complain among yourselves.  
44 No one can come to me unless drawn by the Father who sent me; and I will raise that person up on the last day.  
45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught by God.’ Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.  
46 Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.  
47 Very truly, I tell you, whoever believes has eternal life.  
48 I am the bread of life.  
49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.  
50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that one may eat of it and not die.  
51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats of this bread will live forever; and the bread that I will give for the life of the world is my flesh.”  
52 The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?”  
53 So Jesus said to them, “Very truly, I tell you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.  
54 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have eternal life, and I will raise them up on the last day;  
55 for my flesh is true food and my blood is true drink.  
56 Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood abide in me, and I in them.  
57 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so whoever eats me will live because of me.  
58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not like that which your ancestors ate, and they died. But the one who eats this bread will live forever.”  
59 He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.

#### 1 Corinthians 11:23-26 – Paul recounts the Last Supper.

The Institution of the Lord’s Supper

23 For I received from the Lord what I also handed on to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took a loaf of bread,  
24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said, “This is my body that is for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”  
25 In the same way he took the cup also, after supper, saying, “This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me.”  
26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes.

## The Sorrowful Mysteries

### The Agony in the Garden:

#### Matthew 26:36-46 – Jesus prays in Gethsemane, overwhelmed with sorrow.

Jesus Prays in Gethsemane

36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”  
37 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began to be grieved and agitated.  
38 Then he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and stay awake with me.”  
39 And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not what I want but what you want.”  
40 Then he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “So, could you not stay awake with me one hour?  
41 Stay awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  
42 Again he went away for the second time and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”  
43 Again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.  
44 So leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.  
45 Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  
46 Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.”

#### Mark 14:32-42

Jesus Prays in Gethsemane

32 They went to a place called Gethsemane; and he said to his disciples, “Sit here while I pray.”  
33 He took with him Peter and James and John and began to be distressed and agitated.  
34 And he said to them, “I am deeply grieved, even to death; remain here, and keep awake.”  
35 And going a little farther, he threw himself on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.  
36 He said, “Abba, Father, for you all things are possible; remove this cup from me; yet, not what I want, but what you want.”  
37 He came and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, “Simon, are you asleep? Could you not keep awake one hour?  
38 Keep awake and pray that you may not come into the time of trial; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.”  
39 And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words.  
40 And once more he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy; and they did not know what to say to him.  
41 He came a third time and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Enough! The hour has come; the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.  
42 Get up, let us be going. See, my betrayer is at hand.”

#### Luke 22:39-46

Jesus Prays on the Mount of Olives

39 He came out and went, as was his custom, to the Mount of Olives; and the disciples followed him.  
40 When he reached the place, he said to them, “Pray that you may not come into the time of trial.”  
41 Then he withdrew from them about a stone’s throw, knelt down, and prayed,  
42 “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me; yet, not my will but yours be done.”  
43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and gave him strength.  
44 In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.  
45 When he got up from prayer, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping because of grief,  
46 and he said to them, “Why are you sleeping? Get up and pray that you may not come into the time of trial.”

28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,  
29 and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on his head. They put a reed in his right hand and knelt before him and mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”  
30 They spat on him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.

#### Mark 15:16-19

The Soldiers Mock Jesus

16 Then the soldiers led him into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor’s headquarters); and they called together the whole cohort.  
17 And they clothed him in a purple cloak; and after twisting some thorns into a crown, they put it on him.

19 They struck his head with a reed, spat upon him, and knelt down in homage to him.

#### John 19:2-3

2 And the soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they dressed him in a purple robe.

### The Carrying of the Cross:

#### Luke 23:26-31 – Simon of Cyrene helps Jesus carry His Cross.

The Way of the Cross

26 As they led him away, they seized a man, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and they laid the cross on him, and made him carry it behind Jesus.  
27 A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.  
28 But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  
29 For the days are surely coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’  
30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us’; and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’  
31 For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

#### Matthew 27:31-32

31 After mocking him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him away to crucify him.  
32 As they went out, they came upon a man from Cyrene named Simon; they compelled this man to carry his cross.

#### Mark 15:20-21

20 After mocking him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. Then they led him out to crucify him.  
21 They compelled a passerby, who was coming in from the country, to carry his cross; it was Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus.

#### John 19:17

17 and carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.

### The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus:

#### Matthew 27:33-50 – Jesus dies on the Cross, forgiving His executioners.

The Death of Jesus

45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.  
46 And about three o’clock Jesus cried with a loud voice, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  
47 When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “This man is calling for Elijah.”  
48 At once one of them ran and got a sponge, filled it with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink.  
49 But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”  
50 Then Jesus cried again with a loud voice and breathed his last.

#### Mark 15:22-39

The Crucifixion of Jesus

22 Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha (which means the place of a skull).  
23 And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh; but he did not take it.  
24 And they crucified him, and divided his clothes among them, casting lots to decide what each should take.  
25 It was nine o’clock in the morning when they crucified him.  
26 The inscription of the charge against him read, “The King of the Jews.”  
27 And with him they crucified two bandits, one on his right and one on his left.  
29 Those who passed by derided him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,  
30 save yourself, and come down from the cross!”  
31 In the same way the chief priests, along with the scribes, were also mocking him among themselves and saying, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.  
32 Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, come down from the cross now, so that we may see and believe.” Those who were crucified with him also taunted him.

The Death of Jesus

33 When it was noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.  
34 At three o’clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”  
35 When some of the bystanders heard it, they said, “Listen, he is calling for Elijah.”  
36 And someone ran, filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a stick, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down.”  
37 Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.  
38 And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.  
39 Now when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”

#### Luke 23:33-46

The Crucifixion of Jesus

33 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.  
34 Then Jesus said, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.” And they cast lots to divide his clothing.  
35 And the people stood by, watching; but the leaders scoffed at him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself if he is the Messiah of God, his chosen one!”  
36 The soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine,  
37 and saying, “If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!”  
38 There was also an inscription over him, “This is the King of the Jews.”

The Two Criminals

39 One of the criminals who were hanged there kept deriding him and saying, “Are you not the Messiah? Save yourself and us!”  
40 But the other rebuked him, saying, “Do you not fear God, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?  
41 And we indeed have been condemned justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done nothing wrong.”  
42 Then he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.”  
43 He replied, “Truly I tell you, today you will be with me in Paradise.”

The Death of Jesus

44 It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon,  
45 while the sun’s light failed; and the curtain of the temple was torn in two.  
46 Then Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” Having said this, he breathed his last.

#### John 19:17-30

The Crucifixion of Jesus

17 And carrying the cross by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.  
18 There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them.  
19 Pilate also had an inscription written and put on the cross. It read, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”  
20 Many of the Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.  
21 Then the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but, ‘This man said, I am King of the Jews.’”  
22 Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”
23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier. They also took his tunic; now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.  
24 So they said to one another, “Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see who will get it.” This was to fulfill what the scripture says,
“They divided my clothes among themselves,
and for my clothing they cast lots.”  
25 And that is what the soldiers did.

Jesus’ Mother and the Beloved Disciple

25 Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  
26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.”  
27 Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.

The Death of Jesus

28 After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.”  
29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.  
30 When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

## The Glorious Mysteries

### The Resurrection:

#### Matthew 28:1-10 – Jesus rises from the dead.

The Resurrection of Jesus

1 After the sabbath, as the first day of the week was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb.  
2 And suddenly there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord, descending from heaven, came and rolled back the stone and sat on it.  
3 His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.  
4 For fear of him the guards shook and became like dead men.  
5 But the angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid; I know that you are looking for Jesus who was crucified.  
6 He is not here; for he has been raised, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.  
7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and indeed he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him.’ This is my message for you.”  
8 So they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.  
9 Suddenly Jesus met them and said, “Greetings!” And they came to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.  
10 Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee; there they will see me.”

#### Mark 16:1-8

The Resurrection of Jesus

1 When the sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.  
2 And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb.  
3 They had been saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?”  
4 When they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled back.  
5 As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man, dressed in a white robe, sitting on the right side; and they were alarmed.  
6 But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed; you are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised; he is not here. Look, there is the place they laid him.  
7 But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee; there you will see him, just as he told you.”  
8 So they went out and fled from the tomb, for terror and amazement had seized them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.

#### Luke 24:1-12

The Resurrection of Jesus

1 But on the first day of the week, at early dawn, they came to the tomb, taking the spices that they had prepared.  
2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,  
3 but when they went in, they did not find the body.  
4 While they were perplexed about this, suddenly two men in dazzling clothes stood beside them.  
5 The women were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, but the men said to them, “Why do you look for the living among the dead? He is not here but has risen.  
6 Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee,  
7 that the Son of Man must be handed over to sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.”  
8 Then they remembered his words,  
9 and returning from the tomb, they told all this to the eleven and to all the rest.  
10 Now it was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and the other women with them who told this to the apostles.  
11 But these words seemed to them an idle tale, and they did not believe them.  
12 But Peter got up and ran to the tomb; stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths by themselves; then he went home, amazed at what had happened.

#### John 20:1-29

The Resurrection of Jesus

1 Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from the tomb.  
2 So she ran and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, “They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”  
3 Then Peter and the other disciple set out and went toward the tomb.  
4 The two were running together, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.  
5 He bent down to look in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he did not go in.  
6 Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb. He saw the linen wrappings lying there,  
7 and the cloth that had been on Jesus’ head, not lying with the linen wrappings but rolled up in a place by itself.  
8 Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;  
9 for as yet they did not understand the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.  
10 Then the disciples returned to their homes.

Jesus Appears to Mary Magdalene

11 But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb. As she wept, she bent over to look into the tomb,  
12 and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had been lying, one at the head and the other at the feet.  
13 They said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She said to them, “They have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.”  
14 When she had said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.  
15 Jesus said to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you looking for?” Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, “Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.”  
16 Jesus said to her, “Mary!” She turned and said to him in Hebrew, “Rabbouni!” (which means Teacher).  
17 Jesus said to her, “Do not hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.’”  
18 Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, “I have seen the Lord”; and she told them that he had said these things to her.

Jesus Appears to the Disciples

19 When it was evening on that day, the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”  
20 After he said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.  
21 Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I send you.”  
22 When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.  
23 If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”

Jesus and Thomas

24 But Thomas (who was called the Twin), one of the twelve, was not with them when Jesus came.  
25 So the other disciples told him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see the mark of the nails in his hands, and put my finger in the mark of the nails and my hand in his side, I will not believe.”  
26 A week later his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. Although the doors were shut, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “Peace be with you.”  
27 Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here and see my hands. Reach out your hand and put it in my side. Do not doubt but believe.”  
28 Thomas answered him, “My Lord and my God!”  
29 Jesus said to him, “Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have come to believe.”

### The Ascension:

#### Mark 16:19-20 – Jesus ascends into heaven.

The Ascension of Jesus

19 So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.  
20 And they went out and proclaimed the good news everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that accompanied it.

#### Luke 24:50-53

The Ascension of Jesus

50 Then he led them out as far as Bethany, and, lifting up his hands, he blessed them.  
51 While he was blessing them, he withdrew from them and was carried up into heaven.  
52 And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy;  
53 and they were continually in the temple blessing God.

#### Acts 1:6-11

The Ascension of Jesus

6 So when they had come together, they asked him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”  
7 He replied, “It is not for you to know the times or periods that the Father has set by his own authority.  
8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you; and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”  
9 When he had said this, as they were watching, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.  
10 While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, suddenly two men in white robes stood by them.  
11 They said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven.”

### The Descent of the Holy Spirit:

Acts 2:1-13 – The Holy Spirit descends upon the apostles at Pentecost.

The Coming of the Holy Spirit

1 When the day of Pentecost had come, they were all together in one place.  
2 And suddenly from heaven there came a sound like the rush of a violent wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.  
3 Divided tongues, as of fire, appeared among them, and a tongue rested on each of them.  
4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them ability.

The Crowd’s Response

5 Now there were devout Jews from every nation under heaven living in Jerusalem.  
6 And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered, because each one heard them speaking in the native language of each.  
7 Amazed and astonished, they asked, “Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?  
8 And how is it that we hear, each of us, in our own native language?  
9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,  
10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,  
11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabs—in our own languages we hear them speaking about God’s deeds of power.”  
12 All were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, “What does this mean?”  
13 But others sneered and said, “They are filled with new wine.”

### The Assumption of Mary:

#### Revelation 12:1 – A woman clothed with the sun, often interpreted as Mary.

The Woman and the Dragon

1 A great portent appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.

9 Daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor;
at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.  
10 Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear;
forget your people and your father’s house,  
11 and the king will desire your beauty.
Since he is your lord, bow to him;  
12 the people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts,
the richest of the people 13 with all kinds of wealth.  
13 The princess is decked in her chamber with gold-woven robes;  
14 in many-colored robes she is led to the king;
behind her the virgins, her companions, follow.

### The Coronation of Mary:

#### Revelation 12:1 – A woman crowned with twelve stars.

The Throne for the Queen Mother

19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. The king rose to meet her and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a throne brought for the king’s mother; and she sat on his right.

## The Seven Sorrows of Mary

### The Prophecy of Simeon:

#### Luke 2:25-35

The Prophecy of Simeon

25 Now there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon; this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit rested on him.  
26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he had seen the Lord’s Messiah.  
27 Guided by the Spirit, Simeon came into the temple; and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him what was customary under the law,  
28 Simeon took him in his arms and praised God, saying,  
29 “Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace,
according to your word;  
30 for my eyes have seen your salvation,  
31 which you have prepared in the presence of all peoples,  
32 a light for revelation to the Gentiles
and for glory to your people Israel.”  
33 And the child’s father and mother were amazed at what was being said about him.  
34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed  
35 so that the inner thoughts of many will be revealed—and a sword will pierce your own soul too.”

### The Flight into Egypt:

#### Matthew 2:13-15

The Flight into Egypt

13 Now after they had left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.”  
14 Then Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and went to Egypt,  
15 and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet, “Out of Egypt I have called my son.”

### The Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple:

#### Luke 2:41-50

The Boy Jesus in the Temple

41 Now every year his parents went to Jerusalem for the festival of the Passover.  
42 And when he was twelve years old, they went up as usual for the festival.  
43 When the festival was ended and they started to return, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.  
44 Assuming that he was in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. Then they started to look for him among their relatives and friends.  
45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.  
46 After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions.  
47 And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.  
48 When his parents saw him they were astonished; and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you treated us like this? Look, your father and I have been searching for you in great anxiety.”  
49 He said to them, “Why were you searching for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Father’s house?”  
50 But they did not understand what he said to them.

### Mary Meets Jesus Carrying the Cross:

#### Luke 23:27-31

Jesus Speaks to the Women of Jerusalem

27 A great number of the people followed him, and among them were women who were beating their breasts and wailing for him.  
28 But Jesus turned to them and said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.  
29 For the days are surely coming when they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts that never nursed.’  
30 Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us,’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us.’  
31 For if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?”

### The Crucifixion and Death of Jesus:

#### John 19:25-30

The Crucifixion of Jesus

25 Meanwhile, standing near the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother’s sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.  
26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Woman, here is your son.”  
27 Then he said to the disciple, “Here is your mother.” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home.

The Death of Jesus

28 After this, when Jesus knew that all was now finished, he said (in order to fulfill the scripture), “I am thirsty.”  
29 A jar full of sour wine was standing there. So they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.  
30 When Jesus had received the wine, he said, “It is finished.” Then he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.

### The Body of Jesus is Taken Down from the Cross:

#### Luke 23:50-54

The Burial of Jesus

50 Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph, who, though a member of the council,  
51 had not agreed to their plan and action. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and he was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.  
52 This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.  
53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a rock-hewn tomb where no one had ever been laid.  
54 It was the day of Preparation, and the sabbath was beginning.

### The Burial of Jesus:

#### Luke 23:55-56

55 The women who had come with him from Galilee followed, and they saw the tomb and how his body was laid.  
56 Then they returned, and prepared spices and ointments. On the sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
