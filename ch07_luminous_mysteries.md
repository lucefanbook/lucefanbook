## Introduction

The Luminous Mysteries, also known as the Mysteries of Light, were introduced by Pope St. John Paul II in 2002. These mysteries focus on key moments in Jesusâ€™ public ministry, illuminating his mission and teachings as the "light of the world" (John 8:12). They are traditionally prayed on Thursdays.
