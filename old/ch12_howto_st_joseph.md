# Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows and Seven Joys of St. Joseph

## Introduction

The Chaplet of St. Joseph is a devotional prayer honoring St. Joseph by reflecting on his Seven Sorrows and Seven Joys. Traditionally, it is prayed on a special chaplet with 7 groups of beads, each representing one sorrow and joy. This chaplet highlights St. Joseph’s steadfast faith, humility, and obedience as the earthly father of Jesus. Praying this chaplet helps deepen our trust in God’s providence and invites St. Joseph’s intercession for our needs.

## How to Pray This Chaplet

### Original Structure:

The traditional chaplet uses a specific design:

 * Seven groups of 1 large bead and 7 smaller beads.
 * On the large bead, one reflects on a Sorrow and a Joy of St. Joseph while praying an Our Father.
 * On each smaller bead, a Hail Mary is prayed to honor St. Joseph’s virtues.

## Adaptation for Marian Rosary:

### To fit the chaplet onto a 5-decade rosary:

 * Each sorrow and joy is reflected upon while praying the 10 small beads of a rosary decade.
 * The first 5 decades correspond to the first 5 sorrows and joys.
 * After completing the 5th decade, continue:
   * The 6th Sorrow and Joy on the first decade again.
   * The 7th Sorrow and Joy on the second decade again.
 * Alternatively, choose five sorrows and five joys to meditate upon.

## Sign of the Cross

“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”

## Opening Prayers

### On the crucifix:

“O St. Joseph, whose protection is so great, so strong, so prompt before the throne of God, I place in you all my interests and desires. O St. Joseph, assist me by your powerful intercession and obtain for me from your Divine Son all spiritual blessings, through Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.”

### On the first bead:

Pray the Apostles’ Creed to profess your faith.

### On the next three beads:

Seven Sorrows and Seven Joys of St. Joseph
1. First Sorrow:

Joseph’s doubts about Mary’s pregnancy (Matthew 1:18-19)

“When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.”

First Joy:
The angel’s message of the Incarnation (Matthew 1:20-21)

“But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, ‘Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.’”

2. Second Sorrow:

The poverty of Jesus’ birth (Luke 2:7)

“And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in swaddling cloths and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.”

Second Joy:
The angels’ song and the adoration of the shepherds Luke 2:10-11, 16

“And the angel said to them, ‘Fear not, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.’ ... And they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.”

3. Third Sorrow:

The circumcision of Jesus (Luke 2:21)

“And at the end of eight days, when he was circumcised, he was called Jesus, the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.”

Third Joy:
Naming Jesus and the mission of salvation (Matthew 1:25)

“But he knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.”

4. Fourth Sorrow:

The prophecy of Simeon (Luke 2:25-27, 34-35)

    “And Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother, ‘Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed (and a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed.’”

Fourth Joy:
The salvation of many souls (Luke 2:29-32)

    “Lord, now you are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word; for my eyes have seen your salvation that you have prepared in the presence of all peoples, a light for revelation to the Gentiles, and for glory to your people Israel.”

5. Fifth Sorrow:

The flight into Egypt (Matthew 2:13-14)

    “Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, ‘Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him.’ And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt.”

Fifth Joy:
The overthrow of the idols of Egypt (Isaiah 19:1 (Prophecy))

    “Behold, the Lord is riding on a swift cloud and comes to Egypt; and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence, and the heart of the Egyptians will melt within them.”

6. Sixth Sorrow:

Fear of Archelaus in Judea (Matthew 2:22)

    “But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.”

Sixth Joy:
Life with Jesus and Mary in Nazareth (Luke 2:39-40)

    “And when they had performed everything according to the Law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth. And the child grew and became strong, filled with wisdom. And the favor of God was upon him.”

7. Seventh Sorrow:

Losing the Child Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:45)

    “And when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching for him.”

Seventh Joy:
Finding Jesus in the Temple (Luke 2:46-47)

    “After three days they found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. And all who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.”
