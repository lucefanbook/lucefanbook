Structure of the Rosary of Liberation

The Rosary of Liberation uses the same physical Rosary beads as the traditional Rosary but replaces the prayers with specific invocations focused on liberation and healing.
1. Crucifix

    Begin by making the Sign of the Cross.
    Pray the Apostles' Creed to affirm faith in God and the saving work of Jesus.

2. Opening Beads

    On the first large bead, pray the Our Father:
        Focus on asking God to provide for your needs and to deliver you from evil.
    On the next three small beads, pray three Hail Marys:
        These are offered for faith, hope, and love to increase in your life.

3. The Decades

For each decade (1 large bead and 10 small beads):

    On the large bead:
        Pray the Our Father, affirming God's sovereignty and asking for deliverance.
    On each of the 10 small beads:
        Replace the traditional Hail Mary with this prayer:
            "If Jesus has set me free, I am free indeed. Jesus, have mercy on me! Jesus, heal me! Jesus, save me! Jesus, set me free!"
        Alternatively, personalize the prayer to address a specific need:
            Example: "If Jesus has healed me, I am healed indeed. Jesus, heal me!" (for physical ailments).

4. After Each Decade

    Conclude with the Glory Be, praising the Holy Trinity.

5. Closing Prayers

    After completing all five decades, you may add prayers of thanksgiving, a prayer of consecration to Jesus, or any other personal devotions.
    End with the Sign of the Cross.
