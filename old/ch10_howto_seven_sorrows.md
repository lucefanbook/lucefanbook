# Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows of Mary

Praying the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows deepens compassion for Mary and Jesus. According to tradition, Mary promised special graces to those who meditate on her sorrows:

 * Peace in families.
 * Enlightenment about divine mysteries.
 * Consolation in times of sorrow.
 * Strength to avoid sin.
 * A deeper devotion to Mary.
 * A peaceful death with Mary’s intercession.
 * Direct entry into heaven for those devoted to her sorrows.

The chaplet is usually recited on a seven decade rosary but can be adapted on a five decade rosary.  
Use one decade for each sorrow, completing the Our Father and 7 Hail Marys for each.  
After the seventh sorrow, the chaplet will be complete.
