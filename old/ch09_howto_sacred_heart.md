Step-by-Step Guide
Opening Prayers

    Begin with the Sign of the Cross:
    "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."

## On the crucifix, pray:

Soul of Christ, sanctify me.  
Body of Christ, save me.  
Blood of Christ, inebriate me.  
Water from the side of Christ, wash me.  
Passion of Christ, strengthen me.  
O good Jesus, hear me.  
Within Thy wounds, hide me.  
Permit me not to be separated from Thee.  
From the wicked foe, defend me.  
At the hour of my death, call me.  
And bid me come to Thee,  
That with Thy saints I may praise Thee,  
Forever and ever. Amen.


    On the first large bead (Our Father bead), say:
    "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, burning with love for us, inflame my heart with love for You."

    On the three small beads (Hail Mary beads), pray:
        "Sacred Heart of Jesus, I place all my trust in You." (3 times)

    On the next large bead (Our Father bead), say:
    "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, make me love You more and more."

The Decades

For each of the 5 decades:

    On the Large Bead (Our Father Bead):
    Pray:
    "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I implore that I may ever love You more and more."

    On Each Small Bead (Hail Mary Beads):
    Pray:
    "Sweet Heart of Jesus, be my love." (10 times per decade)

    After completing the 10 beads, conclude the decade with:
    "Sacred Heart of Jesus, have mercy on us."

Concluding Prayers

    After finishing the 5 decades, recite this prayer of consecration:
    "O Sacred Heart of Jesus, I consecrate myself to Your most Sacred Heart. Take possession of my whole being; transform me into Yourself. May my heart be a living temple of Your love, a reflection of Your Divine Heart. Amen."

    Close with the Sign of the Cross.
