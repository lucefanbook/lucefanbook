# Chaplet of the Holy Spirit and His Seven Gifts

## Introduction

The Chaplet of the Holy Spirit is a devotion honoring the Third Person of the Holy Trinity, focusing on the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit (Wisdom, Understanding, Counsel, Fortitude, Knowledge, Piety, and Fear of the Lord). This chaplet deepens our relationship with the Holy Spirit, asking for His guidance and the growth of His gifts within us. It is a beautiful prayer for spiritual renewal, discernment, and grace.

## How to Pray This Chaplet

### Original Structure

Traditionally, the Chaplet of the Holy Spirit is prayed using a chaplet specifically designed with 7 groups of 7 beads, each representing one of the Seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit. The prayers include:

 * An invocation to the Holy Spirit at the start of each group.
 * Specific prayers reflecting on each gift.
 * Concluding prayers for the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.

## Adaptation for Marian Rosary

 * Assign one gift of the Holy Spirit to each decade, starting with the first five gifts.
 * Continue the sixth and seventh gifts on the first and second decades (repeated) after completing the fifth decade.
 * Pray reflective invocations or meditations on the Holy Spirit during each decade.
 * This adaptation ensures all seven gifts are honored within the structure of the rosary.

## Sign of the Cross

“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.”

## Opening Prayers

### On the crucifix, pray:

“Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of Your faithful and kindle in them the fire of Your love. Send forth Your Spirit, and they shall be created. And You shall renew the face of the earth. Amen.”

### On the first bead, pray the Apostles’ Creed

### On the next three beads:

 * Pray 1 Our Father (to honor the Holy Trinity).
 * Pray 3 Hail Marys (for faith, hope, and charity).
 * Pray 1 Glory Be.
