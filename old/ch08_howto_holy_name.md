# How to Pray the Chaplet of the Holy Name of Jesus

## Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions

### Make the Sign of the Cross:

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

### Opening Prayers

On the crucifix, pray:

"O Lord, open my lips, and my mouth will declare Your praise. Incline Your heart to me, O God, and hear my prayers. Through the Holy Name of Jesus, have mercy on me. Amen."

On the Large Our Father Beads (beginning with the first large bead after the crucifix and before each decade), pray:

"Blessed be the Holy Name of Jesus, now and forever."

On the Small Hail Mary Beads, pray:

"Jesus, Son of the Living God, have mercy on us."

On the next large bead (Our Father bead), say:
"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen."

The Decades

For each of the 5 decades:

    On the Large Bead (Our Father Bead):
    Pray:
    "O most Holy Name of Jesus, we adore, praise, and glorify You. Through Your Holy Name, grant us grace, mercy, and eternal life. Amen."

    On Each Small Bead (Hail Mary Bead):
    Pray:
    "Blessed be the Name of Jesus." (Repeat 10 times per decade.)

    After completing the 10 beads, conclude the decade with:
    "Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit, as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world without end. Amen."

Concluding Prayers

    After finishing the 5 decades, recite the Litany of the Holy Name of Jesus (optional). Some prefer to say: "May the Name of Jesus be forever praised, adored, and glorified, in heaven and on earth. Amen."

    Close with the Sign of the Cross:
    "In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen."

Meditative Notes

    Focus: While praying each bead, reflect on the power of Jesus' Name. Think of moments in Scripture where His Name brought healing, salvation, or transformation (e.g., Philippians 2:9-11, Acts 4:12).
    Intentions: Offer each decade for a specific intention, such as the needs of the Church, world peace, conversion of sinners, or personal requests.
