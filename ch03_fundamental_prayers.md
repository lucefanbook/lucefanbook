## The Sign of the Cross

In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

## The Apostle’s Creed or Nicene Creed

I believe in God,  
the Father almighty,  
Creator of heaven and earth,  
and in Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord,  
who was conceived by the Holy Spirit,  
born of the Virgin Mary,  
suffered under Pontius Pilate,  
was crucified, died and was buried;  
He descended into hell;  
on the third day He rose again from the dead;  
He ascended into heaven,  
and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty;  
from there He will come to judge the living and the dead.  
  
I believe in the Holy Spirit,  
the Holy Catholic Church,  
the Communion of saints,  
the forgiveness of sins,  
the resurrection of the body,  
and life everlasting. Amen.

## The Our Father (Lord’s Prayer)

Our Father, who art in heaven,  
hallowed be thy name;  
thy kingdom come;  
thy will be done,  
on earth as it is in heaven.  
Give us this day our daily bread,  
and forgive us our trespasses,  
as we forgive those who trespass against us;  
and lead us not into temptation,  
but deliver us from evil. Amen.

## The Hail Mary

Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee;  
blessed art thou among women,  
and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
Holy Mary, Mother of God,  
pray for us sinners,  
now and at the hour of our death. Amen.

## The Glory Be

Glory be to the Father,  
and to the Son,  
and to the Holy Spirit.  
As it was in the beginning,  
is now, and ever shall be,  
world without end. Amen.

## The Fatima Prayer

O my Jesus, forgive us our sins,  
save us from the fires of hell,  
and lead all souls to Heaven,  
especially those in most need of Thy mercy.

## The Hail, Holy Queen (Salve Regina)

Hail, holy Queen, Mother of mercy,  
our life, our sweetness, and our hope.  
To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve;  
to thee do we send up our sighs,  
mourning and weeping in this valley of tears.  
Turn then, most gracious advocate,  
thine eyes of mercy toward us;  
and after this, our exile,  
show unto us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus.  
O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.

Pray for us, O holy Mother of God,  
that we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.

## Act of Contrition

My God, I am sorry for my sins with all my heart.  
In choosing to do wrong and failing to do good,  
I have sinned against you whom I should love above all things.  
I firmly intend, with your help,  
to do penance, to sin no more,  
and to avoid whatever leads me to sin.  
Our Savior Jesus Christ suffered and died for us.  
In his name, my God, have mercy. Amen.

## The Memorare

Remember, O most gracious Virgin Mary,  
that never was it known  
that anyone who fled to thy protection,  
implored thy help,  
or sought thy intercession,  
was left unaided.  
Inspired by this confidence,  
I fly unto thee, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother;  
to thee do I come; before thee I stand, sinful and sorrowful.  
O Mother of the Word Incarnate,  
despise not my petitions,  
but in thy mercy, hear and answer me. Amen.

## Morning Offerings

O Jesus, through the Immaculate Heart of Mary,  
I offer You my prayers, works, joys, and sufferings of this day,  
for all the intentions of Your Sacred Heart,  
in union with the Holy Sacrifice of the Mass throughout the world,  
in reparation for my sins,  
for the intentions of all my relatives and friends,  
and in particular for the intentions of the Holy Father. Amen.

## Blessing of Food (Before meals)

Bless us, O Lord, and these Thy gifts,  
which we are about to receive from Thy bounty,  
through Christ our Lord. Amen.

## Blessing of Food (After meals)

We give Thee thanks, Almighty God,  
for all Thy benefits,  
who livest and reignest, world without end. Amen.

## Night Prayer

O my God,  
I adore You and I love You with all my heart.  
I thank You for having created me,  
for having made me a Christian,  
and for having preserved me this day.  
Pardon me for the evil I have done this day;  
if I have done anything good,  
please accept it.  
Watch over me as I take my rest,  
and deliver me from danger.  
May Your grace be always with me. Amen.
